## Assumptions

- **A1 – Asynchronous Delivery**  
  Upstream systems do not require synchronous confirmation of delivery; they only need acknowledgment of request acceptance.

- **A2 – Delivery Semantics**  
  System provides **at-least-once** delivery with idempotency guarantees to prevent duplicate notifications to end users.

- **A3 – Notification Volume**  
  Expected load is millions of notifications/day, with burst patterns several times higher. Architecture must support horizontal scale.

- **A4 – Provider Feedback**  
  Third-party providers support webhooks/callbacks for delivery confirmations, failures, bounces, and rate-limit feedback.

- **A5 – Initial Deployment Model**  
  System is initially deployed in a single cloud region, but all components are stateless or partition-tolerant to allow future multi-region expansion.

- **A6 – Centralized Preference Store**  
  User preferences are stored centrally, are read-heavy, and require low-latency access (cache-backed or NoSQL).

- **A7 – Deterministic Template Rendering**  
  Rendered templates must be reproducible for auditing, debugging, and compliance.

- **A8 – Channel Latency Classes**  
  Only SMS/push channels require low-latency delivery; email and paper allow longer windows.

- **A9 – Provider Rate Limits Exist**  
  Providers impose quotas; the system must throttle or defer sends to avoid rejection or blacklisting.

- **A10 – Payload Contains PII**  
  Sensitive content may be included, requiring sanitization in logs, encryption for certain fields, and strict access control.
